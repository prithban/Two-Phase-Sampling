# Two-Phase-Sampling
Codes for Two-Phase Longitudinal Sampling Design
The codes for simulation studies, additional simulations, and the real data analysis is included in this repository. The description of the files are as follows:

1) simulation_study : Simulation codes for all 6 scenarios considered in the manuscript.

2) new_simulation_study : additional simulations conducted as per reviewers request.

3) Hclustcode: Home healthcare study via hierarchical clustering.

4) Mclustcode: Home healthcare study via model-based clustering.

5) Sensitivity_Specificity_check_hclust: sensitivity analysis of home healtcare study via hierarchical clustering.

6) Sensitivity_Specificity_check_mclust: sensitivity analysis of home healtcare study via model-based clustering.

P.S. The real data cannot be included in the github due to restriction. Request for access to the home healthcare study data can be submitted to
